		"reproducibility_guidelines": "One model was trained for each file of the dataset and the same unsupervised thresholding approach as in this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04431) was applied for each in order to find a suitable threshold for each model's deviation.Predicted anomalous sequences are compared with the ground truth and the true positives, false positives and false negatives across all files are collected to calculate the F0.5-Score. Lastly, only the model for file P7 was deployedon-board since all models share the same architecture."
